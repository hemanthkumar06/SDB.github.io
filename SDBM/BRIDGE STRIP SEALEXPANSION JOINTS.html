        <i><h3>An expansion joint or movement joint is an assembly designed to hold parts
                 together while safely absorbing temperature-induced expansion and contraction of building materials, and vibration,
                or to allow movement due to ground settlement or seismic activity.
                They are commonly found between sections of buildings, bridges, sidewalks, railway tracks, piping systems, ships, and other structures.

<i><h3>A general concept of the expansion joint is to provide the c
  ontinuity between two parts of a structure which are in the relative movement because
   of vibration, seismic load, thermal expansion or contraction, shrinkage etc.
   EAn expansion joint is an assembly designed to safely absorb the heat-induced
  expansion and contraction of various construction materials,
   to absorb vibration, or to allow movement due to ground settlement or earthquakes
   expansion joints are designed to support heavy and rigorous traffic load with minimum
   noise and bumps so that the driving experience can be with maximum pleasure.</h3></i>
