    <u>  <h4> HYDRAULIC HOSES</h4></u>
          <h3> <i>A hydraulic hose is specifically designed to convey hydraulic fluid to or among hydraulic components,
          valves, actuators, and tools. It is typically flexible, often reinforced, and usually constructed
          with several layers of reinforcement since hydraulic systems frequently operate at high or very high pressures.</i></h3>

<h3><i>How do you read a hydraulic hose?</i></h3>
<h4><i>Simply put, a dash size refers to a I.D. of a hydraulic hose or fitting in 1/16" increments.<br>
 For example, -6 hose would indicate a hose with I.D. of 6/16" - or 3/8".
 Hoses are measured by inside diameter, unlike tubes which are measured by outside diamete.</i></h4>
<h3>How do I know what size hydraulic hose I need?</h3>
<h4><i>To find out the hose size, check the layline. If the original printing has worn off,
 the original hose must be cut and the inside diameter measured. Be sure to
 measure the overall assembly length and fitting orientation before cutting the hose.</i></h4>
